## Coding Quiz Challenge 4

## Description

This application is designed to let you test your coding knowledge by asking a series of questions regarding JavaScript, HTML, and this coding bootcamp. You are greeted with a screen that shows the title of the application, "Tylers Coding Quiz", and a small statement below it, reading "Test out your coding knowledge with this timed quiz!". There is a "Timer" in the top right of the application, and a button that reads "Start Quiz" below it. Once this button is pressed, the user is presented with a question regarding coding and a 60 second timer starts. If the option chosen for the question is wrong, it will state "WRONG!" below the answers, the clock will go down by 10 seconds, and the next question will pop up. If the chosen answer is correct, it will state "CORRECT!" below the answers and the next question will pop up. This is done for all 5 questions before the user is then presented with the end screen, where they are presented with a button "Play Again?", text below that stating "Enter your highscore!" with a text input box and a "Save Score" button next to it. Below both of those, there is a button with the text "View All Highscores". If the user enters their name and clicks the "Save Score" button, this area will disappear and will be saved with their name and time remaining as their score. If the "View All Highscores" button is clicked, a list of all previous players scores will be listed in descending order. If the "Play again?" button is clicked, the quiz will start again.
